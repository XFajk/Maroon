content_of_log = "I am staying over at this base for a few days. I got assigned with a mission to take inventory in the warehouse and find some weird sample for the science team back at my base.

The team here at Base Alpha is quite friendly and welcoming. Well almost, the captain is a bit creepy. But I find the change of people well for me, when you spend too much time in a small group just a couple of new people makes a hell of a difference.

I'm trying not to think too much about tomrrow. I've heard that Matej doesn't do his job of keeping the warehouse too well. It'll be a lot of work."

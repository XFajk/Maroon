content_of_log = "I am staying over at this base for a few days. I was assigned a mission to take inventory in the warehouse and locate a strange sample for the science team back at my base.

The team here at Base Alpha is quite friendly and welcoming. Well, almost everyone the captain is a bit unsettling. But I find the change of people refreshing. When you spend too much time with a small group, just a few new faces make a huge difference.

I’m trying not to think too much about tomorrow. I’ve heard that Matej doesn’t do a great job of keeping the warehouse organized. It’ll be a lot of work."

content_of_log = "Captain sent me here to fix his doors, his fingerprint scanner is acting up again and for security reasons it has to be reset over here. What a great system. I shouldn't be the one doing this in the first place, the captain just doesn't want to take the hike up here. Either that or he is scared about the whole \"forest\" thing. I feel safe because I know that the comrades at Base Beta have it all under control."

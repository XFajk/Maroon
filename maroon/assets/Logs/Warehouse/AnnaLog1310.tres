There is absolutely ZERO order here. We work like dogs over at Beta to keep everything labeled and sorted, and here they just don’t care. I can’t be bothered with taking inventory. Finding the sample will take long enough, and I don’t want to spend a second longer here than I have to. I feel so wrong in this place, like something’s about to go really bad."

Efforts are being made to restrain it, or maybe scare it off. I don’t care I want it as far away from me as possible. I’ve been holding this information from Base Alpha for way too long. They should know before more people get lost. I’m even thinking about relocating them here. Base Alpha isn’t equipped with enough security measures. How will they cross the forest? Only God knows. May He help us."
